# ROGUESPY
### Made for [Charity Game Jam](http://charitygamejam.com)

Break into Soviet embassies and pilfer top secret documents in this 2D tactical turn-based strategy game. Face off against bumbling security guards, disciplined soldiers and very well trained KGB agents, pick up those documents and run to the exit!

You can play the game [here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/56192083/NES/ROGUESPY/index.html).

## How to play:
You start with 4 health and a silenced pistol.  
You have 5 Action-Points (AP) to use per round. Actions cost _x_ AP:  
**Move:** 1 AP (per tile)  
**Fire:** x AP (depends on weapon, rifles take less AP to fire)  
**Take:** 1 AP (per pickup)  
**Wait:** Ends your turn

## Controls:
**Arrow Keys:** Move/Target/Pickup  
**Space:** Accept action  
**Left Control:** Cancel action

## Tips:
* Your starting weapon, the silenced pistol, takes 3 AP to fire. If you bumble around a corner with 2 AP left, you'll alert anyone in sight but be unable to respond until next round. Time your entrances  
* Enemies have their own AP and will chase you down if they see you, make sure you get the first shot  
* The rifle is a significant upgrade, if you can kill a soldier and take it from him!  
* Some levels have more than one exit
